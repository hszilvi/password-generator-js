# Overview
This is the second solution of the 5th week challange, called Password Generator. I recreated the challange to practice using Javascript functions, etc.

## My_process
At first I wrote the pseucodes to create a "to do" list before create the code.
Using thsese pseucodes I created the functions.
Later I made the code shorter as I revisioned my code.
After testing the code, I find bugs, so I added extra code lines like reset function to the code.

I wrote the readme.md with the relative path to screen shot and links and other expected contents. 

### Built_with
Javascript, VS code

## What_I_learned
I learned a lot about Javascript functions. 

### Continued_developement
- deeper understanding of functions
